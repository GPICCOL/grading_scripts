## Analysis of submissions by student

This is a small report to identify students who are not submitting practices

```{r cars}
#Create full roster
nm <- unique(read.csv("../analysis/id.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)[ , 2:5])
#Read grades
fl <- read.csv(paste0("all_grades.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE, strip.white = TRUE)
fl <- merge(nm, fl[, c(3, 11:12)], by = "pawsid", all.x = TRUE)

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(with(fl, table(pawsid, label)))
t <- rowSums(with(fl, table(pawsid, label)))
```

\pagebreak

The following are the students who have yet to submit an assignement.

```{r}
kable(fl[fl$pawsid %in% names(t)[t == 0], 1:4])
```
